# Algorithm Tutorials (Java)

This repository contains my weekly algorithm tutorial implementations using Java.

## Structure

Each week’s tutorial is organized inside:

src/
  ├── week01/
  ├── week02/
  ├── week03/
  └── ...

Each folder contains the solutions and code for that week.

## Topics Covered (so far)

- Nested loops
- Time complexity analysis
- Performance measurement
- (More topics will be added weekly)

## Purpose

- Strengthen algorithm fundamentals
- Practice Java problem-solving
- Understand time complexity trends
- Maintain consistent Git workflow
